# Academic Oasis Discord Bot Template

Hi, I am Eric and I am your **CTO** and this is the template I have made for you guys to follow.  
This should show you how to get started with making a default discord bot using [**Discord.py**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) along with the format you will have to follow.
 
## Getting Started

Before we can actually run the bot we need to make the bot user.

### Creating the Bot User

To start go to the [**Discord Developer Portal**](https://discord.com/developers/applications), Login and then click on **New Application**.  

Give it a name and make sure the Team is set to Personal (See [Note 1](#note-1))



## Notes
<a name="note-1"></a>
1. For testing you will use your personal Token but in production we will have Team and the Bots will use those Bot Tokens. It is most likely that being in the Team will be reserved to high level staff for safety reasons. This is the importance of the **.ENV** file along with safety concerns.
